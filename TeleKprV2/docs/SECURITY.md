# Security Improvements Applied

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variables
- Created `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- Removed hardcoded Supabase credentials from `src/admin/crm-server.js`
- Added validation to ensure required environment variables are set

### 2. CORS Configuration
- Replaced wildcard CORS with environment-based allowed origins
- Added proper CORS configuration with credentials support
- Default fallback to localhost origins for development

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Added middleware to sanitize user input and prevent XSS
- Implemented request size limits (10MB)
- Added basic HTML entity encoding for string inputs

### 4. Deployment Security
- Removed hardcoded IP address from deployment script
- Made VPS_IP and ADMIN_PANEL_PORT configurable via environment variables
- Added fallback values for deployment variables

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your actual values in `.env`:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: Your Supabase service key
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed origins
   - `VPS_IP`: Your VPS IP address for deployment

3. For deployment, set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export VPS_IP="your.vps.ip.address"
   export ADMIN_PANEL_PORT="8090"
   ./deploy-on-vps.sh
   ```

## Security Features Now Active

✅ **Environment-based configuration** - No more hardcoded secrets  
✅ **Proper CORS policy** - Only allowed origins can access the API  
✅ **Input sanitization** - XSS prevention on all string inputs  
✅ **Request size limits** - Protection against large payload attacks  
✅ **Configurable deployment** - No hardcoded IP addresses  

All functionality has been preserved while significantly improving security posture.
