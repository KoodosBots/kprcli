Core Architecture: The product includes a browser extension, a CLI, and remote control capabilities.
      How do you envision these components interacting? Will they be independent, or will they communicate
      with a central backend service for managing profiles, form templates, and remote commands?

 the telegram bot interacts with the extension then the extension to the cli client

AI's Specific Role: Could you elaborate on the "AI learning" process? Is the AI's primary role to
      intelligently map descriptive labels (e.g., "First Name") to their corresponding HTML form fields, or
      is it expected to handle more complex logic, like navigating multi-step forms and understanding
      conditional field visibility?

      yes and scrape the url that the form is on or navigating to the sign up form studys the code to fill out the form to score 100
      if the form doesnt get 100% the form errors are logged and is ordered by anthoer agent to self improvement but ai learning is going off filling out forms and learning 


       Client Data Storage: Since client profiles must be accessible by both the browser extension and the
      CLI, what is the proposed storage mechanism? Will it be a local database file (e.g., SQLite) on the
      user's machine, or is the cloud sync feature a mandatory component from the start?

      user data will be stored on their pc but the account created and device information is saved on my supabase 

      Technology Stack Preference: The document mentions Playwright for automation and suggests either
      Node.js or Python for the CLI. Is there a preferred technology for the CLI and any potential backend
      services? Choosing this early could help in creating a more unified codebase.
