💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Speed

Start conversations with full context - Give Claude/GPT-5 your entire architecture upfront
Use Claude for structure, GPT-5 for algorithms - Each has strengths
Test as you build - Don't wait until the end
Keep iterations small - Build, test, refine, repeat

📊 Realistic Expectations
What you'll have in 3 weeks:

✅ Working Chrome extension
✅ Form recording and replay
✅ AI learning from variations
✅ Client profile management
✅ 10-20 parallel executions
✅ Payment processing
✅ Basic Telegram control

What might take longer:

Advanced server deployment (add 1-2 weeks)
Enterprise features (add 2-4 weeks)
Comprehensive AI training (improves over months)

🎯 My Recommendation
Phase 1 (Week 1): Build core with Claude Code - get something working
Phase 2 (Week 2): Add intelligence with GPT-5 - make it smart
Phase 3 (Week 3): Polish and launch - start making money
Then iterate based on user feedback while you're already generating revenue!
With Claude Code and GPT-5, you're looking at 3 weeks to a sellable product versus 2-3 months doing it manually. The AI assistants will write 90% of your code - you just need to guide them and piece it together.RetryKgive me a user flowEditI'll provide you with a comprehensive user flow for your AI-powered form filling system:
